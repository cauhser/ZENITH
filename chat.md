#AI Interaction Overview
    Primary AI: "Grok & Qoder" used for visual design generation, UI/UX structuring, feature ideation, technical architecture planning, and full‑stack code specification with real‑time search and content reasoning capabilities.​

    Outcome focus: Transformed a static multi‑page pitch into a professional, interactive single‑page landing experience paired with a live wellness dashboard prototype for demos.

#Prompting Details:

**1st Prompt: “generate some photos for this website project” + system architecture layers**
    Response Summary: Produced six high‑fidelity mockups (extension install, webcam emotion capture, AI engine, alerts, dashboard, journey map) in a teal‑blue glassmorphism style tuned to Hong Kong Gen Z aesthetics.​
    
    Influence: Locked the visual identity and demo‑first narrative so stakeholders immediately see real interactions rather than static slides.

**2nd Prompt:"suggest some function I may add on this website"**
    Response Summary: Suggested 10 engagement features including Live Demo Mode, Wellness Score Quiz, Campus Ambassador Program, Trigger Word Cloud, AI Coach, and PDF Export.
    
    Influence: Shifted from static pitch to interactive growth engine — added virality, trust, and scalability.

**3rd Prompt:"suggest the layout and the functions on the chrome extension"**
    Response Summary: Full Manifest V3 spec with popup UI, background service worker, eye-tracking (WebGazer.js), emotion AI (TensorFlow.js), on-device processing, and Focus Mode.
    Influence: Turned concept into shippable browser extension — core product now technically validated.

**4th Prompt:"suggest some function I may add on dashboard"**
    Response Summary: Added 12 dashboard features like Daily Pulse, Trigger Radar (HK campus map), AI Coach chat, Digital Sunset, and Community Circles.
    Influence: Dashboard evolved from data display to proactive mental wellness coach — now personalized and predictive.

**5th Prompt:"help me make the web page more well classicify and organise" → clarified as dashboard**
    Response Summary: Delivered clean single-page dashboard layout with sticky header, glass cards, interactive timeline, Leaflet map, and AI chat — fully responsive.
    Influence: Final product is judge-ready, user-friendly, and deployment-ready.

#Project Evolution:

**Breakthrough #1:From PDF to Live Demo**
    Grok’s mockup generation and Qoder's Live Demo Mode suggestion replaced static slides with an in-browser prototype, making the solution tangible and credible for JUMPSTARTER judges.

**Breakthrough #2:From Passive Tracker to Active Coach**
    AI suggestions like AI Wellness Coach, Proactive Nudges, and Trigger Radar transformed Zenith from a monitoring tool into a real-time emotional guardian, directly addressing Gen Z isolation.

**Breakthrough #3:From Concept to Code-Ready**
Full Chrome extension spec (Manifest V3, WebGazer, TensorFlow.js) and dashboard tech stack (React, Chart.js, Supabase, WebLLM) gave us a concept of how to let out idea become to pratical project and insightful tool.

Refinement:Privacy-First by Design
Every AI response emphasized on-device processing, no raw video storage, user consent — aligning with HK PDP compliance and campus ethics boards.
