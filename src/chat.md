AI Interaction Overview:
The AI tool used was Grok (built by xAI). Its primary roles were visual design generation, UI/UX structuring, feature ideation, technical architecture planning, and full-stack code specification — transforming a static 6-page PDF pitch into a professional, interactive single-page landing page and real-time wellness dashboard.

Project Evolution:

Breakthrough #1:From PDF to Live Demo
Grok’s mockup generation and Live Demo Mode suggestion replaced static slides with an in-browser prototype, making the solution tangible and credible for JUMPSTARTER judges.
Breakthrough #2:From Passive Tracker to Active Coach
AI suggestions like AI Wellness Coach, Proactive Nudges, and Trigger Radar transformed Zenith from a monitoring tool into a real-time emotional guardian, directly addressing Gen Z isolation.
Breakthrough #3:From Concept to Code-Ready
Full Chrome extension spec (Manifest V3, WebGazer, TensorFlow.js) and dashboard tech stack (React, Chart.js, Supabase, WebLLM) gave the team a 1-week MVP roadmap — no longer just a pitch.
Refinement:Privacy-First by Design
Every AI response emphasized on-device processing, no raw video storage, user consent — aligning with HK PDP compliance and campus ethics boards.
